# Daily Trivia

## Objective
Show a series of trivia questions to answer. The questions will rotate through random categories and difficulties while always showing four answer choices. If answered incorrect, the correct answer should show. A record of the session will be kept track of both correct and incorrect answers. A `reset` button is included to set the tracker at 0.
